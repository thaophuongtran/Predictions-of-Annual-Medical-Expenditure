---
Thao Tran

In this anlysis, we use neural networks to provide predictions on annual insurance premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customer based on their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits and region of residence. The goal is to estimate annual medical expenditure for new customers using the above measures. Our data of over 1300 customers comes from Kaggle, ["Medical Insurance Payout"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/medical-insurance-payout?resource=download), with the following variables:
* `age`: Age of the customer
* `sex`: Gender
* `bmi`: Body Mass Index, an important health factor
* `children`: Number of children
* `smoker`: Whether the customer smokes or not
* `region`: Region of the country the customer resides
* `charges`: The annual insurance expenditure for the customer
